Peer suggestion 1 (Nathan Mclain): 

    I'm not sure if you are using the "back to top" as placeholder links, 
    but in my option they don't offer any use to your website while in 
    desktop sizing. It would be beneficial to add the link to your media 
    query when the pictures do take up more space and it has a use. 
    That way it cleans up your website a little. 

Changes made:
    Added media queries to hide the "Return to top button" when all content 
    is displayeda single viewport. Removed "Return to top" link from Music page.     


Peer suggestion 2 (Nathan Mclain): 

One thing would be cool to see is some sort of description of the photos 
you took and or edited to give more context to users who may not be super 
familiar with your work. you could add a hover effect that gives a short 
description of the photo, or even when you click on an image it 
brings you to a new page that has more about it. 


Changes made:
    Added hover effect to photography page that displays image 
    title and location.
